* The unit of time is ‘day’. The accuracy of the data is to a minute (=7*10^(-4)day).

* All 320 runs (both 2010 and 2011 data) are considered for this analysis.

* Contains only waiting times with less than 12 hours(=0.5 day) since one shift ends within 12 hours.

* Contains only waiting time between two consecutive RUNs, not events. 
Since the time difference between two events at same run is less than a second, we assume events with same run occurred at the same time, and those are not counted in this data sheet. Therefore, there are no waiting time data with ~0 second.
