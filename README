For information on installation and use of this code, please
refer to Code_Documentation.pdf in the Documentation directory.

to-do list:
  *Run simulations for many different charges
  *Decide how to pick quip direction for generate_event_times()
  *Correct for Daylight Savings time in shift times/run times data
  *Add code to calculate/plot the other correlation coefficients
    for z-position and speed/trap angle
  *Make Plots of CDFs with median/mean/mode of null CDF labeled
  *Figure out why signal_group.set_n_sets() can take so long (it
    has something to do with saving the signal group.  It's
    writing way too much data)

Low-priority to-do list:
  *Check if java/X is available before generating Charman histograms
    so that it doesn't produce errors when running without that
    ability.
  *Create a signal function that depends on theta_trap
  *Fix the recursive references of signal funciton handles to
    themselves, which causes their saved .mat files to be larger
    than they should be.
  *Have someone read the documentation?
  *Set up cluster to run 64 processes?
  *Figure out why Matlab graphics are so slow on server?
  *Install vim 7.4 on server?
